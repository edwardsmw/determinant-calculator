# ARM Determinant Calculator

This program calculates the determinant of a matrix, size up to 5x5. The implementation is with the na√Øve Laplace expansion, which is an inefficient O(n!) algorithm. The 5x5 size limit is arbitrary; larger matrices have not been tested.

## Compilation

```bash
make -B
./determinant_calculator
```
